<h3>HTML IMAGES</h3>
<h4>Here I am using img tag</h4>
<p>The given image location is wrong. Therefore, instead of image the alternate will work and show as "loading."</p>
<img src="img1.png" alt="loading" width="100" height="150">
<p>In this case, we gave a wrong file location and also we didn't gave any alternate statement.</p>
<img src="img1.png" " width="100" height="150">
<p> Given image location as path. Because in this case, the file location and image location are different.</p>
<img src="D:\Kaveri\HTML\images\img1.png" alt="loading" width="400" height="200">
<p>Here, the image and html file locations are same. So just mentioned the image name only.</p>
<img src="img2.png" alt="loading" width="600" height="300">
